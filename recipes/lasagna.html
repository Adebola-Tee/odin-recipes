    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The perfect lasagna recipe made with parmesan ricotta cheese filling, melted mozzarella cheese,<br> lasagna noodles, and a robust tomato meat sauce. It is the best lasagna recipe!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Melted mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Parmesan ricotta cheese filling</li>
        <li>Robust tomato meat sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Start by making a homemade meat sauce.</b> This is done by sautéing an onion in olive oil until it begins to soften.<br>This brings out the sweet flavor of the onion. Then it is time to brown the ground beef until it is browned and the onion is softened. <br>Stir in the marinara sauce and let it simmer on low.  If you want your lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding ½ jar more marinara sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Make a parmesan ricotta cheese mixture.</b> This is what gives the lasagna the creamy filling. I love to flavor the ricotta cheese<br> with a good amount of parmesan cheese, spices, and egg to bind it together.</li>
        <li><b>Use your favorite lasagna noodles.</b> There are two choices for lasagna noodles -- oven-ready pre-cooked noodles or lasagna <br>noodles that need to be cooked before hitting the oven. I have tried both ways and can attest that they both work!</li>
        <li><b>Bring on the cheese!</b> The best lasagna is full of cheese so be generous with the layers of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li><b>Bake covered for 15 minutes</b> and then remove the foil and continue to cook until the cheese is bubbly. Let it set up for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
