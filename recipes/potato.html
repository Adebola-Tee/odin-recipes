    <h1>Baked Potato</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These baked potatoes are fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. They’re exactly the kind of baked potato I’ve<br> been craving. If you share my definition of what a baked potato should be, you could call these potatoes <i>perfect.</i></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 to 4 medium Russet potatoes (7 to 9 ounces each)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt or kosher salt, for sprinkling</li>
        <li>Desired toppings, such as sour cream, butter, chives, salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prick your potatoes with a fork</b> about six to eight times per potato. You don’t have to aggressively stab the potato. Pricks about 1/4-inch deep will do. Without these ventilation holes, potatoes can explode in the oven—don’t let this happen to you!</li>
        <li><b>Do not wrap your potatoes in aluminum foil.</b> Foil traps moisture, which produces a soggy exterior. We want the excess moisture to escape from the potato during baking. That way, we’ll get crispy outsides and condensed potato flavor on the insides.</li>
        <li><b>Bake at a relatively high temperature</b> (450 degrees Fahrenheit). This is a trick I learned from America’s Test Kitchen that proved true in my recipe tests. They explain that baking in a hot oven prevents a leather “pellicle” from forming underneath the peel.</li>
        <li><b>For the best baked potato, don’t stop there.</b> Once the potatoes are cooked through, remove them from the oven and brush them lightly all over with melted butter or oil, then sprinkle them with salt. Return the potatoes to the oven on the middle rack for medium-crisp exteriors, or raise the rack by a level or two for ultra crispy exteriors.</li>
    </ol>
